# DataStructureAssignment3
 This is the program that will display the node's movie name and release year (If it does have a release year) of the tree if it matches the movie element in the csv file. It's important to note that the inner classes are made after main as oppose to the usual way of establishing classes before main. Hope it solves the problem. Thank you and stay safe.
